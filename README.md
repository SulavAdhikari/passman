<h1>Password manager</h1>

i introduced myself to web development using python.
this is a simple web app that lets you create your user account and then you can save your password and the name of the website.
it is made using flask frame work. 
it uses flask's in build sqlalchemy called flask-sqlalhemy to define and interact with models in database.
for simplicity it uses sqlite database which is also what flask users use by default.
